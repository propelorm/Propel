published: true

With <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/changeset/1639">revision 1639</a>, Propel 1.5 has reached the 3000th unit test in the test suite. That&#39;s more than three times the number of unit tests in Propel 1.4 (928), and six times the number of unit tests in Propel 1.3.<p /><div>Propel 1.5 is going to be the most robust Propel release ever. Even though we added a lot of features, we&#39;re very confident that Propel will run smoothly in your applications, thanks to the quality insurance provided by unit tests and test-driven development.</div>
